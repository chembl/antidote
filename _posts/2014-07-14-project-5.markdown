[CentOS](https://www.centos.org) (Community Enterprise Operating System) is a Linux distribution which provides a free, enterprise-class, community-supported computing platform, functionally compatible with its upstream source, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

CentOS emphasises on security and is therefore very popular among system and network administrators. It is also widely used as a production operating system in enterprises with large IT resources and infrastructure.
Similar to Ubuntu, CentoOS Linux is free to use and redistribute.

CentOS-based Antidote distribution is build on top of CentOS 7.
