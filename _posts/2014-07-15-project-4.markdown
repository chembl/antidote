[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/), also known as 'Linux for human beings' is a Debian-based Linux distribution, commited
to the principles of open-source software development. Because of its user-friendliness, Ubuntu is one of the most
popular Operating Systems and can be found preinstalled on PCs, laptops and mobile phones.
It's also widely supported by cloud platforms such as Amazon EC2, OpenStack and DigitalOcean.

This is why Ubuntu is a default OS for the myChEMBL platform and should be an OS of choice for people that are new
to myChEMBL.

The current myChEMBL release is using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.
