[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a new open-source project that automates the deployment of distributed applications.
It takes advantage of new cool features of modern Linux kernel in order to run virtual containers, thus avoiding the overhead of starting and maintaining virtual machines.

In contrast to virtual machines, which emulate virtual hardware, Docker containers employ the kernel of the host machine
so they don't require or include the whole operating system. While still separated from the host, they only add a very
thin level of abstraction.
