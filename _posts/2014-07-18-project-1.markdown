Installing the Antidote prototype (myChEMBL) using Virtual Box is the default option for most users. You will need to:

1. Install [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
2. Download <a href="ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/chembl/VM/myChEMBL/releases/myChEMBL-20_0/Ubuntu/VirtualBox/ubuntu.vmdk.tar.gz" class="download-link">myChEMBL disk image</a>,
   this will download the latest version of myChEMBL by default; if you want to get different one, check the [archive](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/chembl/VM/myChEMBL/releases/).
   The file containing the myChEMBL image is quite large (several GBs), so you may want to make sure you have a stable
   internet connection. You may also want to use a download manager (or FTP program) in order to be able to restore the
   process in case your internet connection drops. Finally, you have to check the location where the file is saved, this
   is usually your system-defined Downloads folder.
3. Once your copy of the myChEMBL image is downloaded, you have to unpack it. You can do it by double-clicking on the
   file icon if you have the archive utilities installed in your system. On Unix systems you can do it from the command line
   by executing:

       tar -zxvf ubuntu.vmdk.tar.gz

   in the Downloads folder.
4. Create a Virtual Machine.
   Start the VirtualBox application and click on the New button to create a new VM, and then Next.

5. Enter a name such as mychembl, and choose Linux as the “Operating system”, and Ubuntu as the “Version”.
   ![VB select name](img/virtualbox_select_name.png){: .img-responsive }

6. In the next screen, set the memory to 1024 MB (or more if your host computer has more than 4GB).
   ![VMDK memory](img/vmdk_memory.png){: .img-responsive }

7. Continue to the next screen and choose “Use existing hard disk”.
   Now click on the button (a folder icon) to browse to where you saved the ubuntu.vmdk file.
   Select this file, press Next and Create.
   ![VMDK disk](img/vmdk_disk.png){: .img-responsive }

8. Now bootup the VM by clicking the Start (green arrow) button. Once the myChEMBL system finish booting, you can
   navigate your browser to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and start using it.
