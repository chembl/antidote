## Executive Summary

**Vision:** we propose XX, an open source, state-of-the-art, end-to-end platform which enables the complete life cycle of data acquisition, curation, storage, mining, dissemination and reuse for chemoinformatics and drug discovery applications. Specifically, the resource combines *open* chemical, pharmacological and chemogenomics data and analogous in-house data with *open source* chemoinformatics and data science tools, and interactive demos, tutorials, documentation and use-cases to produce a free, end-to-end, accessible, and intuitive platform for data-driven drug discovery. We envisage that this will catalyse and facilitate i) academic and collaborative drug discovery; ii) teaching, learning and dissemination of data science applications for drug discovery to all levels of the scientific community; iii) reproducibility and sharing of research; iv) synergy between different institutions and domain experts; and v) accessibility for those from non-computational disciplines to adopt and employ computational methods.

**Implementation:** As an existing early-stage prototype, we will use myChEMBL, which was co-developed by members of our team at the EBI. myChEMBL is a virtual machine which hosts the ChEMBL database and a number of data analysis tools. We plan to heavily extend and scale-up myChEMBL by combining existing open data content, established open source chemoinformatics tools, data science and analytics technologies, as well as data curation and querying web platforms and applications built by members of our team. Importantly, the resulting platform will be modular, scalable and accessible via several deployment methods.

**Audience:** We envisage that XX will be a widely adopted platform in both academia and industry and among researchers of diverse backgrounds and experience, ranging from students to experts and from wet-lab scientists to computational ones. Particularly, we expect that XX will become indispensable to institutions with limited resources, such as academia, not-for-profit organisations, research institutes in developing economies, SMEs, CROs and biotechs.
