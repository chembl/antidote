# Antidote: An open platform for data-driven drug discovery applications

**George Papadatos, Michal Nowotka, Nathan Brown, Greg Landrum and Patrick Walters**

## Executive Summary

**Vision:** we propose [**Antidote**](http://chembl.github.io/antidote/), an open source, state-of-the-art, end-to-end platform which enables the complete life cycle of compound data acquisition, curation, storage, querying, mining, dissemination and reuse for chemoinformatics and drug discovery applications. Specifically, Antidote combines *open* chemical, pharmacological and chemogenomics data and analogous in-house data with *open source* chemoinformatics and data science and mining tools, along with interactive demos, tutorials, documentation and drug discovery use-cases in a *free*, *accessible* and *intuitive* platform. We envisage that this will catalyse and facilitate:

1. Academic drug discovery *via* easy access to standardised infrastructure, data and use-cases; 
2. Accessibility and dissemination of modern informatics and computational applications for data-driven drug discovery to all levels of the scientific community; 
3. Interactive teaching and learning of chemoinformatics and data mining concepts and applications;
4. Reproducibility and sharing of research methodologies and outcomes; and 
5. Synergy and collaborations between different institutions and domain experts outside drug discovery.

**Implementation:** As an existing early-stage prototype, we use [myChEMBL](http://www.mdpi.com/2078-1547/5/2/334/htm), which was co-developed by members of our team at the EBI. myChEMBL is a virtual machine which hosts the [ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) database and a number of data analysis tools. We plan to heavily extend and scale-up myChEMBL by combining existing open data content, open source data mining and analytics technologies, as well as user-friendly data curation and querying web platforms and applications built by members of our team. Importantly, the resulting platform will be modular, scalable and accessible via several deployment methods. 

**Audience:** We envisage that Antidote will become a widely adopted data analysis and reuse platform among researchers of diverse backgrounds and experience, ranging from students to experts and from wet-lab scientists to computational ones. Particularly, we expect that Antidote will become indispensable to institutions with limited resources, such as academia, not-for-profit organisations, and research institutes in developing economies.
